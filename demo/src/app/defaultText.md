# Notescapes Demo Document

Welcome to Notescapes! This document showcases various features of our Obsidian-like editor.

## Basic Formatting

You can make text **bold** using double asterisks and _italic_ using underscores. You can also mark text as ~~strikethrough~~ using double tildes and ==highlight important information== using double equals signs.

For code, use `backticks` for inline code or create code blocks:

```javascript
// This is a JavaScript code block
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

## Lists

### Unordered Lists

- First item
- Second item
  - Nested item 1
  - Nested item 2
- Third item

### Ordered Lists

1. First step
2. Second step
   1. Sub-step A
   2. Sub-step B
3. Third step

### Task Lists

- [ ] Pending task
- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Another pending task

## Tables

| Column 1  | Column 2  | Column 3  |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Data 1    | Data 2    | Data 3    |
| More data | More data | More data |
| Last row  | Last row  | Last row  |

## HTML Integration

<div style="background-color: #f0fff0; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 20px 0;">
  <h3>HTML Component</h3>
  <p>This is an HTML block with custom styling.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Item one</li>
    <li>Item two</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Mathematical Expressions

Inline math: $E = mc^2$

Block math:

$$
\frac{1}{\Bigl(\sqrt{\phi \sqrt{5}}-\phi\Bigr) e^{\frac25 \pi}} = 1+\frac{e^{-2\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-4\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-6\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-8\pi}} {1+\ldots} } } }
$$
